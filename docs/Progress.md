⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
1. TypeScript Issues (Critical)
// Current issues detected:
- Module resolution errors for @/ imports
- Missing type declarations
- Implicit 'any' types in some callbacks
Recommendations:

Restart TypeScript server
Verify path aliases in tsconfig.json
Add explicit types for callback parameters
2. Database Integration (Medium Priority)
// Currently using mock data
const sampleData = [...]

// Should implement:
- Real database operations
- API routes for CRUD operations
- Server-side data fetching
3. Error Handling (Medium Priority)
// Add global error boundary
// Implement retry mechanisms
// Better network error handling
4. Performance Optimizations (Low Priority)
// Consider adding:
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo for computed values
- Virtualization for large tables
🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED
1. Fix TypeScript Module Resolution
The main issue is TypeScript not recognizing the path aliases. This is likely due to IDE cache:

# Try these solutions:
1. Restart TypeScript server in IDE
2. Delete .next folder and rebuild
3. Restart development server
2. Fix components.json Schema
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json", // Fix typo: "$sche" -> "$schema"
  // ... rest of config
}
🚀 ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Add API Layer (High Priority)
// Create API routes
app/api/inventory/route.ts
app/api/inventory/[id]/route.ts

// Implement server actions
lib/actions/inventory-actions.ts
2. Add Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
Search & Filtering: Add search functionality
Pagination: Handle large datasets
Bulk Operations: Select multiple items
Data Validation: Server-side validation
Audit Trail: Track changes
3. Add Testing (Medium Priority)
// Add testing framework
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
4. Add Security Features (High Priority)
// Implement:
- Authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Authorization (role-based access)
- Input sanitization
- CSRF protection
